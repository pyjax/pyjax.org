**Abstract:**

In this talk I will share how I use PyCharm in my day-to-day work as well as for side-projects, and as a side-topic dive into python project structure and the import logic.

PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or simply put: An editor with bells and whistles, it is based on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDE with a focus on Python and its various frameworks.

Python projects, no matter the shape, need to assume a structure in order to function properly, there are many practices, I don't know which is best, but I'll share which work for me and why others didn't.

I might also have some time to talk about what I mean by "project shape".
